# VR-Chemistry-Simulator
A (very) limited chemistry simulator built with Unity VR for a Dalyell Research Project.

## The Project
The idea was to create a chemistry simulator in Unity VR to help teach 1st year students about nucleophilic substitution. The logic being that since it's quite a spatial phenomenon students would find it easier to learn by interacting with the molecules.

This was done as part of the [SCDL1991](sydney.edu.au/units/SCDL1991) unit at The University of Sydney. The project supervisors were [Dr. George-Williams](sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/stephen-george-williams.html) and [Dr. Pullen](sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/reyne-pullen.html).

## The Outcome
Unfortunately a single semester is not enough time to design and develop an entire VR Chemistry simulator in Unity, especially for a single person, but I gave it my best shot, and I think it turned out pretty good considering.

[Here](https://youtu.be/icApRZI4-Rk) is a clip of it in action two weeks before I made the final build, after which I had to shift my focus to the report and presentation writing, which were actually assessed.
